# iOS-Themes
A collection of icons, widgets, and wallpapers for iOS. 
![Screenshots of my minimalish theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpasholk/iOS-Themes/main/minimalish-icon-theme/minimal-tranparent-icon-theme-preview.png)

In this theme I use the Shortcuts app to help create the transparent icons and set them as "bookmarks" on the homepage to act as app icons. Perhaps I'll do a write up on how it's done in the future, but all that information can be found online elsewhere.

## Support

Help support my work! I have a full-time job and like to mess around with this stuff on my own time. Donatations are insanely motivating!
